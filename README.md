Satellite Image Enhancement for Environmental Monitoring
Overview
This project aims to develop a digital image processing solution for enhancing satellite images to facilitate effective environmental monitoring. The primary objective is to improve the visual quality of satellite data, enabling better discrimination of land features, vegetation, and environmental changes.

Problem Statement
Satellite imagery is a valuable tool for monitoring environmental changes, but raw satellite data often lacks clarity and detail, making it challenging to discern important features. This project addresses the need for enhancing satellite images to provide clearer and more informative visualizations for environmental monitoring purposes.

Goals
Develop algorithms for enhancing satellite images to improve visual quality.
Increase the clarity and detail of land features, vegetation, and environmental changes in satellite imagery.
Create a user-friendly solution that can be easily integrated into existing environmental monitoring systems.
Ensure the processed images maintain their accuracy and fidelity to the original data.
Features
Image preprocessing techniques for noise reduction and enhancement of contrast.
Enhancement algorithms tailored for different types of environmental features such as land, vegetation, and water bodies.
Adaptive filtering methods to preserve image details while reducing noise.
Integration with geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial analysis and mapping.
Options for customizing enhancement parameters based on user preferences and specific environmental monitoring requirements.
